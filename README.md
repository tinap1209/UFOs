# UFOs-The Truth is Out There.
We have come to learn that there are a lot of UFOs sightings out there. Research also shows that there is life and its other forms out there in the Extra Terrestrial. Many people have come forward and show us that UFOs do exist. Some have shown keen interest in looking through the reports as well. The data is super intense and would to go through it manually is tedious. [dataset](UFOs/data.js). WE want to make out website simple and easy to access along with filters to the table data for specific values using specific values using only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js on our web pages.
* All CSS, JS and images were supposed to be in the `static`folder. HTML files are uploaded as well. I clearly had problems with my git push and git add, which is why I have uploaded the files than pushing them on git hub

* For the people that believe that aliens are real and that the truth is out there with definitely fine this rather interesting [UFO Sightings](https://github.com/tinap1209/UFOs.git)

* As a part of the Modules we were asked to create an index.html file, a basic HTML web page that was created to display the dataset of UFO sightings. The same file is also uploaded for reference. 

* On the webpage the user will have the option to search by date, city, country and shape.

* A filter was created using a date form where a user can select a date value from the filter table. A function called `filterTable()` was created using JavaScript that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input and displays these to the webpage.

## Results
* For the results the user can pick a city or country and will get reports and data accordingly. 

## Drawbacks
* I honestly do not see any drawback with the webpage. It is simple to understand and user friendly. Take a look yourself [UFO Sightings](https://github.com/tinap1209/UFOs.git).

# Recommendations
* What I additionally wanted to do was to attach some links that draws data from other pages.

* A data source of Bibliography section.
